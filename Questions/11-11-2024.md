1. **Legality of Model Weights Copyright**: Can model weights be considered a work of authorship protected under US copyright law?
2. **Balancing User vs. Inventor Freedom**: Should the freedom of the user outweigh the freedom of the inventor in the context of ethical licensing?
3. **Effectiveness of Restrictive Licensing**: Is attempting to control the use of a publicly released work through licensing effective, or should inventors not release it if they fear misuse?
4. **Definition of Open Source for Models**: What constitutes "open source" for AI/ML models; is providing just the model weights sufficient?
5. **Encouraging Contributors with Ethical Licensing**: Can ethical open-source licenses encourage more diverse contributors to the open-source ecosystem, thereby democratizing AI/ML?
